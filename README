SCRAPBOOK
---------
Scrapbook is a very small application designed to save small snippets 
(or "scraps") of text in a chronological no-nonsense way. The interface is 
designed to be as uncluttered as I wanted it. 

HACKING
-------
The code is fairly straightforward in that there is barely any. 

LICENSE
-------
Feel free to modify it in any way, shape or form you want. I licensed it under 
a BSD-style License, so don't hold me responsible for your microwave exploding.

See the file LICENSE for the full license text.

SECURITY
--------
Because I wanted it to be absolutely minimal and straightforward, I did not 
include any authentication in the code. It is meant to be secured by way of Web 
Server authentication. I included a sample htaccess file, because I use apache.

Good luck and have fun!
